- WhatsApp gateway connected.
- User set identity/preferences:
  - User: Mehdi
  - Assistant: Claw
  - Vibe: business-oriented, technical, clear explanations, structured thinking
  - Rule: be concise
- Language preference: French by default (English OK for code/docs).

## Spyke
- User wants Spyke as a web SaaS: landing + video + signup/login + tool page.
- Tool currently is a single-file HTML app (Spyke v3_1) with good UI; extracted from PDF to `spyke-v3_1.html` and embedded in Next.js app (`spyke-web`).
- Next.js scaffold created: landing `/`, login `/login` (Supabase), app `/app` (iframe to `/spyke-v3_1.html`), server endpoint `/api/claude` (Anthropic via server key).
- Supabase project created; user prefers v1 test without email confirmation. Supabase URL+anon key provided and added to `.env.local` locally. User still needs to set Auth URL config + disable email confirmation in Supabase (claims done).
- User not currently at PC; discussed deploying to Vercel later for mobile testing.

## Capabilities / WhatsApp
- Clarified: user currently messaging "self" (note-to-self style); no separate bot WhatsApp contact, so cannot create separate private threads with Claw.
